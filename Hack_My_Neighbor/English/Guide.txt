Guide to play hack my neighbor
-I apologize if there is any translation error
-It is recommended to have a minimum of experience with commands, although you can play without knowing anything, just follow the guide
-At no time close the game window or the entire game will be lost.
-All commands and """hacks""" are fictitious and do not seek to incite unethical hacking or cracking, it is only done for the purpose of entertainment

To be able to play we need to know the commands, for that we use the "help" command, something to emphasize is that all the commands are in lowercase, without spaces or accents.

 Let's start this adventure, first let's see that we have files with the "dir" command. Now open the file "mision.txt" by typing its name and its extension, that is, type "mision.txt" to open it.
Once you finish reading the file, close it and go back to the terminal, now we have to enter the explorer, for that we need internet, use the "ipconfig" command to see the network status and open ports, there you will see something like this:

*******************************
IP: 192.168.1.254
Mac: 2607:f8b0:4012:800::200e
Open ports: 8080
Closed port: 52400
WiFi: false
*******************************

The Open ports is in 8080 so we have to change it to 52400 to be able to have an internet connection, for this we have to use the "newport" command and press enter to invert the ports, now let's go back to check the network status by going back to using the "ipconfig" command should output something like this:

*******************************
IP: 192.168.1.254
Mac: 2607:f8b0:4012:800::200e
Open ports: 52400
Closed port: 8080
WiFi: true
*******************************

If it appears that means that the ports were correctly inverted, now we have access to the internet.
The next thing will be to use the "start -e" command to start the browser.
already inside the explorer we have to enter this github repository: https://github.com/Mc-zet4/Ethernet-Explorer.git
there we will find something like this:

************************************************** ** ****************
Ethernet Explorer: https://github.com/Mc-zet4/Ethernet-Explorer.git

.git
passwords
commands

Move to: <= Here we will put the name of the folder we want to go to
************************************************** ** ****************

There we will find 3 options: ".git" is to exit github, the one that says "passwords" is a folder and we can write its name to move to it, the one that says "comands" is a folder and we can write its name to move To her.
First we enter the folder "passwords" where we will find the password of the file "secret_files.zip" Copy and paste the password here:

Password for "secret_files.zip":

Alright now press any key to return to the previous menu. Now let's enter the "comands" folder where we will find 2 secret commands, copy and paste the commands here:

Secret command1:
secret command2:

We are almost done, now touch any key to return to the previous menu, in the main menu we will type ".git" to exit. Now we will use the "dir" command to view the files, then we open the file "secret_files.zip" putting its full name correctly. Now we extract the folder with the "Key_finder" file using the old password (keeping the game window open). Once extracted, we execute the "Key_finder" file to get the key and have super user rights, copy and paste the key here:

super user key:

To have super user rights we close the "Key_finder" window and return to the game terminal to enter the "sudo" command, it will ask us for a key, there we put the previous key. Now with the superuser permissions we will proceed to dox the neighbor. Using the secret command 1 (termination: finder) we enter the command and there it will be looking for nearby ips and that of our neighbor is the closest.

neighbor's ip:

after finding the ip we use the secret command 2 (termination: delete) we enter the command and then we will have to enter the ip of the neighbor to destroy it. Once destroyed the job is done.

The End.

2 endings
 At the end of the end 1, a new command will be unlocked in the "help" which we can use to connect to the neighbor through ssh, for this we will have to write the command "ssh" we will see something like this:
*******************
port: <= Here we can put one of these ports [21,22,25,80,110,443,3306,5000]
ip: <= Here we will put the ip of the neighbor
*******************
After connecting remotely (we can do "whoami" to check) we will have to enter the explorer to download some malware, for this we use the command "start-e" and in the search bar we will put "malware" and download and install it

The End.
